EVTNAMECS1;The Dual Monarchy Question;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESCCS1;Both the Kingdom of Hungary and Kingdom of Croatia were once united under a common Hungarian king. Now that we have a stable position in Central Europe, we could push our claim on the entirety of Illyria. On the other hand, Romanian nationalists are becoming increasingly in favor of establishing their own state. We've ruled Transylvania for centuries and as such we could instead claim the Crown of Romania. In any case, we find ourselves in the position to establish a Dual Monarchy which would easily secure our place amongst the Great Powers of Europe.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
